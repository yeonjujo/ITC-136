Vim is a pretty great text editor, but learning to use it effectively can be a challenge. 
Even if you keep a quick-reference card or cheatsheet around, it can be difficult to figure out which commands are the most useful. 
But the truth is, Vim can still be super helpful if all you know is a few commands. 
So I’ve compiled a few of the Vim commands that I use every day.

h j k l
Basic movement keys. A step up from the cursor keys simply because they are already under your fingers. 
Most useful when prefixed with a number (e.g. if you need to move down by about 10 lines, 
hit “10j” instead of just holding j until you get there).

ctrl+u ctrl+d
Basically Page Up and Page Down, but moves by half a screenful and doesn’t lose your cursor position.

ctrl+o ctrl+i
Move backward/forward through the jump history. Useful if you have followed a chain of method calls and need to get back to where you were.

cc
Correct line(s) by clearing and then entering insert mode. Starts inserting at the current indent level.

dd
Delete line(s). Quickly rearrange lines by deleting them, moving to the new location, and pasting with “p”.

u ctrl+r
Undo and redo.
